# Cybersecurity Basics — Internship Task 1

## 1. CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality:** Only authorized users can access data.
- **Integrity:** Data cannot be tampered or altered without detection.
- **Availability:** Systems and data are accessible when needed.

## 2. Common Threat Types
- **Phishing:** Fake emails/websites trick users to give sensitive info.
- **Malware:** Malicious software (virus, trojan, ransomware, spyware).
- **DDoS:** Distributed Denial of Service — overload a system to make it unavailable.
- **SQL Injection:** Inject malicious SQL to manipulate databases.
- **Brute Force:** Attempting passwords repeatedly until success.
- **Ransomware:** Encrypts data, demands ransom for decryption.

## 3. Attack Vectors
- **Social Engineering:** Trick humans into revealing sensitive info.
- **Wireless Attacks:** Exploit weak Wi-Fi security.
- **Insider Threats:** Attacks by employees or internal users.

# Networking Basics — Internship Task 1

## 1. OSI Model Layers
1. Physical — cables, hardware
2. Data Link — MAC addresses, switches
3. Network — IP addressing, routing
4. Transport — TCP/UDP, port numbers
5. Session — manage connections
6. Presentation — encryption, formatting
7. Application — HTTP, FTP, DNS, email protocols

## 2. TCP/IP Protocol Suite
- IPv4 / IPv6 addressing
- TCP (reliable, connection-oriented)
- UDP (fast, connectionless)
- ICMP (ping)

## 3. DNS & HTTP/HTTPS
- **DNS:** Converts domain names to IP addresses
- **HTTP/HTTPS:** Web communication; HTTPS = encrypted

## 4. IP Addressing, Subnetting, NAT
- **IP Address:** Unique network identifier
- **Subnetting:** Dividing IP space into smaller networks
- **NAT:** Network Address Translation — allows private IPs to access public internet

## 5. Common Commands (Linux/Kali)
- `ifconfig` / `ip a` — check IPs
- `ping <ip>` — test connectivity
- `netstat -tuln` or `ss -tuln` — open ports
- `traceroute <ip>` — route packets take
